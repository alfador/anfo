v1 - Initial release

v1.1 - Let linux users use better features of raw_input
     - Page viewer no longer shows the list of pages again when a user
       prompts for help.
     - Viewing the queue also shows the rating of each song
     - pageviewer now has a 'stats' command
     - pageviewer now has a 'global_stats' command

v1.2 - Viewing queue displays the average overall rating, too.
     - Fixed minor bug in global_stats
     - Allowed more commands in the pageviewer, so you don't have to switch
       between the pageviewer and the main anfo prompt nearly as much
     - Improved error messages
     - Added shuffle command to pageviewer, so you can choose songs more or less
       randomly.
     - Added update command, which updates song information for a particular
       song.  This is useful if you want to update the total_rates or rating
       field of songs, for example if you want to remove songs from a list of
       unrated songs.

v1.3 - 'anfo.py' is the new main.
     - Added 'delete' command, so you can manually get rid of songs that have been
       deleted from anfo.
     - Added 'info' command
     - Did a major refactoring of the code.
